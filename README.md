# Creating company panel data out of company names with OpenAI LLM API

Author: Pipe Galera (fcm.si@cbs.dk)

ðŸš§ WIP - scripts and prints will change.

## Output `.dta` file fields

These are _NOT_ rules for the LLM, this are "human" explained definition of the variables.

- `BVD_ID`: the BVD of the company.

- `year`: year range from 1995 to 2015, in panel format.

- `establishment_year`. The establishment year of the company.

- `company_name_orbis`. The name of the company according to Orbis, stays constant.

- `company_name`. Tracks if the legal company name changed year by year.

- `company_name_international`. The name of the company in a second format, given by the raw file.

- `parent_company_name_orbis`. The name of the direct parent company according to Orbis. This field is only populated if the company is a subsidiary. Given that companies can be Joint Ventures (JVs), there can be multiple parent companies.

- `parent_company_ownership_years`. Ownership Dates in years. From which year to which year the parent company had ownership of the subsidiary. Notice range years can go before 1995 and beyond 2015 (e.g. 2000-2015+).

- `parent_BVD_ID`: the BVD of the parent company, if the name of the company is avaiblable on the "Ownership_data_for_ChatGPT.dta" file. If the name of the owner is not in the file (e.g. "Eon Electric Ltd", "Government of Gujarat"), then the ID is not populated. Since the name of the owner is LLM generated and the .dta file do not contain all the possible arent company for all possible years, this field cannot be complete.

- `parent_company_country`. The country of the headquarters of the parent company.

- `JV`. 1 if the company is owned by a Joint Venture, 0 if not.

- `GUO`. The name of the Global Ultimate Owner (if it`s a subsidiary). In case of a JV, itwill be the name of the company with more ownership. In case of a 50:50 ownership, there can be multiple GUOs (e.g. IN0000249001).

- `GUO_BVD_ID`: the BVD of the Global Ultimate Owner, if the name of the company is avaiblable on the "Ownership_data_for_ChatGPT.dta" file. If the name of the owner is not in the file (e.g. "Eon Electric Ltd", "Government of Gujarat"), then the ID is not populated. Since the name of the owner is LLM generated and the `.dta` file do not contain all the possible arent company for all possible years, this field cannot be complete.

- `GUO_country`. The GUO's headquarters country.

- `GUO_fav_india`: the name of the Global Ultimate Owner, "favorizing" Indian companies.

  _For multiple GUOs_:
  - 50:50 Indianâ€“Foreign: this field will only display one the Indian GUO (e.g. IN0000249001).
  - 50:50 Indianâ€“Indian: this field is the same as `GUO`.
  - 50:50 Foreignâ€“Foreign: this field is the same as `GUO`.

  _For a single GUO_:
  This field is the same as `GUO`. If the GUO is a single company (e.g. no JV with Indian company), it will display the only owner regarless of the country as there is no Indian company to favorize (e.g. 'IN0000249001' or 'IN\*110157064108' in 2015).

- `GUO_BVD_ID`: same as `GUO_BVD_ID` field but for `GUO_only_india`. Same restrictions apply.

- `sources`: The URL of the online sources that the LLM used to extract the information. If you are in doubt on why it wrote a given peace of information at a given year, visit the URL under sources.

## Scripts

- `merge_raw_data.py`: Merges the 2 raw files given by the researcher.

- `llm_web_search_call.py`: OpenAI web search call to scrape a individual company information from the internet. **Using gpt-5 at real-time, it cost around $0.10 to $0.20 per company**

- `llm_code_interpreter_call.py`: OpenAI code_interpreter call to format the data from `llm_web_search_call.py` into a readable dataframe. **Using gpt-5 at real-time, it cost around $0.05 to $0.10 per company**

- `post_llm_format.py`: formats the response from OpenAI into a readable `.csv` file, with extra fields and clean formatting.

- `loop_all_companies`: Loops `llm_company_call.py` and `post_llm_format.py` for every BVD ID in the raw master file.

- `merge_processed_data.py`: merges all companyc`.csv` files into a single file "master file" in `.csv` and `.dta` formats.

## Example of use

### Loop all companies

In most cases, you would like to loop over a certain number of companies to extract their information. For example, limiting the reseach for 2 companies (`--limit`):

```
(gpt) pg@mbpwork dev % python src/loop_all_companies.py --limit 2

Already processed: 0/1845 companies
Limiting to 2 new companies (skipping already processed ones).

### Skipping already processed companies

The scripts skip the companies already processed via LLM to avoid extra costs.

```
(gpt) pg@mbpwork dev % python src/loop_all_companies.py --limit 3

Already processed: 2/1845 companies
Limiting to 3 new companies (skipping already processed ones).
Processing companies:   0%|                                    | 0/5 [00:00<?, ?it/s]

### Reloading responses for a single company

If the data generated is not satisfactory for a company, just delete the `_websearch.json` or/and `_json.json` files from the `response` for the given company in the `responses` folder and call the single company scripts sequentially.

```
(gpt) pg@mbpwork dev % python src/llm_web_search_call.py --bvd_id "IN31739FI"
âœ— Web search LLM response not found. Running llm_web_search_call.py...
